## Ma siamo davvero qui?

Since there is a bright and a dark theme in Jamdocs, you will need two logotypes. Just replace the two svg files in `src/assets/img` where the dark on is named `logo-dark.svg` and the bright one is named `logo-bright.svg`. If you canÂ´t provide SVG logos, you can just change the file format to for example PNG in line 5 and 10 `src/components/Logo.vue`.
